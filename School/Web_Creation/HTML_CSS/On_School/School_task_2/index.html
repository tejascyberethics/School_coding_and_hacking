    <p>Clean India is a collective responsibility. We can achieve it through simple acts like proper waste disposal, avoiding littering, and promoting recycling. Community engagement, awareness campaigns, and strict enforcement of cleanliness laws are also crucial. By working together, we can transform India into a nation where cleanliness is a way of life.</p>
